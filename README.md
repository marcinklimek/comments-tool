- UV package manager (recommended) or pip

### Using UV (Recommended)

1. Install UV if you haven't already:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd translate-jp
```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

4. Install the package:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the tool in several ways:

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Scan files for Japanese characters
comment_tool --scan

# Scan for non-ASCII characters in a specific file
comment_tool --scan-non-ascii --file path/to/file

# Scan files for BOM characters
comment_tool --scan-bom

# Remove BOM characters from files
comment_tool --remove-bom

# Process files and extract Japanese comments
comment_tool
```

## Output

The tool generates the following files:
- `translations.json`: Contains extracted Japanese comments and their translations
- `translation.log`: Processing details and debug information

## Development
